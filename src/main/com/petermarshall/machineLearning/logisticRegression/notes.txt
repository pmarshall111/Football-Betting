MODEL WILL HAVE TO BE UPDATED MANUALLY IF USING OCTAVE PRODUCED DATA. pretty much decided not to use WEKA. Takes far too long to create model (1.65 days of computing time)


Things we need todo:

Add in all_theta vals and test.






TODO: Could possibly add in an idea of changing how much money we put on a bet depending on how much it outperforms the bookies odds.
TODO: Could also add these together if multiple models suggest it is a good bet. (i.e. betterThanBetters + goodRatio)

TODO: CHECK TO SEE IF IT GIVES US AN ADVANTAGE TO CHECK WHETHER OUR WIN ODDS ARE ALSO BETTER THAN BOOKIES WIN ODDS WHEN LOOKING AT RATIOS. RIGHT NOW WE'RE JUST LOOKIGN AT THE RATIO.


Optimisation ideas:
-Instead of just looking at the raw data in terms of a teams rating or whatever, look at the comparison between the teams. That way we should have values that are around 0 and smaller so
will be faster to converge. Also would mean we would have fewer features so we could do powered features on a bigger percentage of the features we have.

- Look at changing the calculating ratio thing to doing w/w+l and l/w+l instead of w/l and l/w?

- Add in a variance on the amount of money you're placing depending on how much higher it is above your limit.

- Should we actually look at the logits we're getting to see if they are positive? No point betting on something that is just more likely than the other results if our model doesn't
think it's likely at all.


Combinations:

RIGHT NOW WE ARENT EVEN USING OUR FORM WEIGHTED VALUES... THE WHOLE MASTERPLAN BEHIND THE CALCULATIONS!!!!!!! FFS


- What we expect the home team to score (avg g - away avg gA, avg xG - away avg xGA, avg wG - away avg wGA, form g - away form gA, form xG - away form xGA, form wXG - away form wXGA)  6
repeat for away team 6
repeat for home team @home form 6
repeat for away team away from home form 6

home team total points
home team home points
away team total points
away team away points
repeat for last 5 points, scored first + conceeded first + team strength 20

home team points vs opposition
home team home points vs away opposition (no need to have away as they will just be a mirror of the home)

home weighted lineup rating - away weighted lineup rating
home home weighted lineup rating - away away weighted lineup rating

48 features. still less than what we currently have. can then combine 1/3 of those to powers and see how we do.
