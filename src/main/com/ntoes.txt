TODO:

1. setup task scheduler to scrape in played games and also to predict games to be played today.
2. Clean up code and think through whether things are working correctly.
3. Setup tests to ensure things work correctly. (format of scrape sites stays the same, ordering of features is same in training as predicting, calcs in creating data work correctly)
4. Optimise system.




Operation:

1. Scrape in recently played matches from the day before
2. Setup timers to decide when to scrape for lineups and get bets to predict



JUST TEST WE CAN PREDICT OKAY AND RECEIVE EMAILS.
ENSURE OUR IMPLEMENTATIONS OF DECIDING ON GOOD BETS ARE THE SAME IN BOTH JAVA AND OCTAVE.
ADD EVERYTHING INTO TASK SCHEDULLER.



todo: setup task schedullers and then you're done.




Tasks we need to schedule:

- Updating played games. (YEP)
- Scraping and predicting games to be played today (YEP)
- Performance updates once a month. (YEP)
- Reminder to retrain model with updated data... Possibly once every 2 months? (YEP)
- Reminder to add new season. (YEP)
